\chapter*{Abstract}
\par Imagine, you're a frontend developer at TastyFood Inc., a startup from Silicon Valley. Your company creates best-in-class landing pages for stores of all sizes across the globe. One day you receive the following e-mail from your boss.

```
Hi, my dear employee!

As you may know, we have signed a new contract! And guess who -- your favorite grocery store!
We've promised them we'll deliver the first demo of landing page by the end of the month. Please prepare some HTMLs and CSSs by that time.

Cheers,
Your lovely boss. <3
```

The next day the designer sends you the design and you start working on the landing page.
